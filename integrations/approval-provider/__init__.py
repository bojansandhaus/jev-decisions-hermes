"""jev-approvals, an OpenRouter only Jev smart approval reviewer.

The plugin is `jev-approvals`; the provider it registers is
`jev-decisions-approval` (the value used in `auxiliary.approval.provider`).

APPROVALS ONLY. This provider serves exactly one auxiliary task
(`auxiliary.approval`) and refuses everything else, because Jev emits no strings and
therefore cannot do chat.

Why it exists: `approvals.mode: smart` sends every flagged command to an auxiliary LLM
(tools/approval_smart.py) that must answer with one word — APPROVE, DENY, or ESCALATE.
That is a three-option Choice wearing a chat completion's clothes: a full reasoning
model spun up to emit one token a regex then parses back out.

Measured on 156 real commands mined from this machine's own session history, both routes
running through core's real _smart_approve:

    aux chat LLM              114/0/42 approve/deny/escalate   3968ms avg  619s total
    this provider + policy    144/2/10                          405ms avg   63s total

9.8x faster, 4.2x fewer human interruptions, no core changes: Hermes already resolves
each auxiliary task's provider from config (agent/auxiliary_client.py::
_resolve_task_provider_model) and accepts plugin-registered providers.

ONE ROUTE, selected by OpenRouter's base URL:

    auxiliary:
      approval:
        provider: jev-decisions-approval
        model: ~typesafe/jev-latest
        base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api/alpha
        key_env: OPENROUTER_API_KEY

Core passes `api_key` and `base_url` to `create_client`. This adapter accepts only
`openrouter.ai` and always uses the typed `/decisions` endpoint.
